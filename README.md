# Data Journalism and D3

* Created [interactive scatter plots](https://anulkar.github.io/D3-Challenge/) using [this D3.js script](https://github.com/anulkar/D3-Challenge/blob/master/assets/js/app.js) to show health risks facing particular demographics for each US state.

* The analysis is based on [a Census data set](https://github.com/anulkar/D3-Challenge/blob/master/assets/data/data.csv) for 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. It includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.
